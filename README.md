This mod is my first attempt at modding, and will be rough around the edges on the backend, but I plan to do my best to keep it spick and span on the player facing side. 

Short term goal is whatever comes to my mind and is within my capabillities, hence the name of "Another Random Mod". All sorts of oddities will populate the early game of the mod as I learn and evolve as a dev

Long term goal is a mod where the player hops through several dimensions, some being fully realized randomly generated worlds, some being curated experiences in a small prebuilt worldspace, and others being glorified boss arenas
all of this to assemble and empower the most powerful of swords "The Armament" the peak of weaponry. Each dimension will have 1 or more bosses and mini bosses, which once killed using "The Armament" will bestow upon it a new power.
I plan for 10 stages in the "final" build, but more may be added as I get ideas and expand the scope of the mod. For example after finishing I may decide to do a bow as well, criss crossing it's progression in between the sword's
required dimensions and some required dimensions and bosses of it's own. Like I said, we'll see.

Current Planned Bosses (it's loosey goosey so don't expect any in depth explanations here.)
1. Primos - The Angelic Host
2. Duodecious - The Undying Lich
3. "Demonic Boss"
4. "Clown Boss"
5. "Steampunk Boss"
6. "Shrunken Boss"
7. "Prehistoric Boss"
8. "Space Boss"
9. "Cultivation Boss"
10. "Final Boss"
